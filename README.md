# My Recipe Book 
This is a desktop application created with react, javascript, and electron. It stores the baking recipes which I've designed as recipe cards. It consists of a fixed 512px x 512px window and a custom 
designed cursor. 
## Goals
1. Practice desktop application development
2. Explore React, Javascript, and Electron
3. Improve on front-end applications
4. Make something expressive and personal
